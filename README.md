# Dungeon
A Javascript Dungeon Game to run in the command line. This is based off the same idea of an  old project of mine called "Terminal-Dungeon" and can be found [here](https://github.com/mamamia5x/Terminal-Dungeon). 

This project has nothing to do with the old one, just the same premise. I have done numerous similar projects on this idea, and Terminal Dungeon is one of the surviving versions, along with an old battle simulator I made a while back.

`node index.js`

Not done at all :(
